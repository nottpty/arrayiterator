# ArrayIterator by Patinya Yongyai (5710547204)

Many collections and data structures provide an Iterator so we can iterate over all the elements in the collection without knowing the structure of the collection

Arrays don't have an Iterator, but it would be really useful to have one.

For convenience, we will design the Arrayiterator so it will skip null elements in the array.
